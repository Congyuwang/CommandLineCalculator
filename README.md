## Help Menu

This is a simple calculator program that allows _variable definition_, and supports _basic functions_ like exponential, logarithm, and square root. The smallest floating number is 1E-30. Any number smaller with an absolute value smaller than that is treated as 0.

### Keymap

- ```ENTER``` (calculate result)
- ```UP_ARROW``` (previous input)
- ```DOWN_ARROW``` (next input)

### Variable names

Must start with a latin letter, and follows latin letters or numbers and underscores. Examples: ```a1, number_of_apples, alpha__```.

### Supported operators (in descending order of priority)

- ```()``` (parenthesis)
- ```!, +, -``` (logical_not, unary positive, unary negative)
- ```^``` (power)
- ```*, /, %``` (multiply, divide, remainder)
- ```+, -``` (plus, minus)
- ```>, <, >=, <=``` (greater, less, greater equal, less equal)
- ```==, !=``` (equals, not equals)
- ```&``` (logical_and)
- ```|``` (logical_or)

### Supported functions

- ```sqrt()``` (square root)
- ```exp()``` (exponent)
- ```gamma()``` (gamma function)
- ```factorial()``` (factorial function)
- ```log()``` (natural logarithm)
- ```log2()``` (logarithm base 2)
- ```log10()``` (logarithm base 10)
- ```sin()``` (sine)
- ```cos()``` (cosine)
- ```tan()``` (tangent)
- ```asin()``` (inverse of sine)
- ```acos()``` (inverse of cosine)
- ```atan()``` (inverse of tangent)
- ```sinh()``` (hyperbolic sine)
- ```cosh()``` (hyperbolic cosine)
- ```tanh()``` (hyperbolic tangent)

### Predefined variables (can be reassigned if needed)

- ```e``` = 3.141592653589793
- ```pi``` = 2.718281828459045

### Supported assignments

- ```=```
- ```+=```
- ```-=```
- ```*=```
- ```/=```
- ```%```
